Creating A wifi fireworks igniter with a backup LiPo battery.

With December just around the corner I wanted to design a remote fireworks igniter working on wifi and battery power.

The board will use mosfets as switches to nichrome wire which will heat up and ignite fireworks from a safe distance.

Required components:

- 1x 100 x 100 PCB [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/VERO100100)
- 1x ESP8266 12F [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/ESP-12F)
- 4x IRL520N mosfet [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/IRL520N-TO-220)
- 4x Nichrome wire coils from old vape coils
- 2x 100k resistor look for 1% [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/RES-100K-50)
- 5x 100k resistor 5% [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/RES-100K-50)
- 4x 10k resistor 5% is fine [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/RES-10K-025)
- 4x 560 ohm resistors 5% is fine [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/RES-560E-50)
- 4x 1N5822 Schottky Diodes [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/1N5822-TH)
- 1x Boost Voltage Regulator [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/V228-2A)
- 1x battery holder [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/18650-1C-TH)
- 2x 100nf capacitors [here]()
- 1x 10uf cap [here]()
- 1x 1000 uf cap [here]()
- 1x LiPo charger with protection [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/PK4056) or [LiPo charger & 5v boost](https://www.robotics.org.za/MH-CD42?search=lipo%20charger%203.7v%202a%20in%205v%20%20%20led%20level%20indicator)
- 1x button [here]()
- 1x jumper [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/CCC01505C-20?search=jumper)
- 4x 2 pin screw terminals [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/KF120-2P-254)
- 1x 4 pin screw terminal [here](https://www.robotics.org.za/TC-4P-254)
- Female and male headers [here]()
