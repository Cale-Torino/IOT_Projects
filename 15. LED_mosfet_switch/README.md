# LED mosfet switch

A simple PCB using the sonoff P04 Esp8266 modual to switch mosfets for my workshop.

The unit has an auto backup battery switching circuit and uses 12v from mains and battery.

Mosfets used can handel up to 10A of current and I have applied a heatsink to the LED Fet which could draw up to 7.5A.

The other 3 Fets are for: remote alarm siren, remote operation of 1 security gate and remote fog pepper spray.
