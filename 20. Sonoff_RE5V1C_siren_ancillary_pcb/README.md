#  Sonoff RE5V1C siren ancillary PCB

The sonoff RE5V1C is a DC powered ESP8285 PCB with a 10A relay.

The PCB has a push button on it and indication LEDs but has no cover

In this example I am using the unit to switch a siren remotely.

The unit gets power from a 12v battery wich is charged from mains. 
A DC/DC buck converter steps down the 12v to 3.3v efficiently.

Screw terminals secure wires to the PCB.

Component list:
- 1x Sonoff RE5V1C
- 1x stripboard board
